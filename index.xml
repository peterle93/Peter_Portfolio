      <description>Disaster Response Pipeline Project The goal of the project is to classify legitimate messages sent during disaster events from a dataset provided by Figure Eight. It requires us to build machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages according to the needs communicated by the sender on a real time basis. The specific machine model is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model.
The project is divided into three main sections:
Building an ETL pipeline to extract data, cleaning the data and storing it into a SQlite Database.</description>

      <description>Toronto Airbnb Dataset Analysis
The Motivation for the Project
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. I used Toronto Airbnb Dataset for this project as its the city I live in. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using data science techniques to analyze ways to improve future listings. The questions analyzed may be similar to data sources one might encounter in a business setting. Additionally, many of the approaches and skills used in this project can be applicable to future work projects.</description>

      <description>Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist people in researching the most optimal and resourceful locations near their neighborhood. It will provide the necessary information in making the best decision on selecting the neighborhood you would like to live in.
Many people move into parts of Canada and need tons of prior research dealing with factors such as suitable housing prices, well-known schools for their children, and so on.</description>
